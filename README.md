# Postal Service Application 
Postal Service application built for my data structures and algorithms class using Python. 
The application works by taking in a list of packages to be delivered under various time constraints and storing the packages in a hash table.
It then splits the packages up into three different delivery vehicles and uses a greedy algorithm to decide the best route for each vehicle to take.
While the packages are being delivered the package information in the hash table is being updated to provide current package statuses.
The application has a user interface which can be accessed through the console to request information about package status and delivery times.
### To run the program download and open it in an IDE, then run the program, once it is running you will be able to interact with it through the user interface located in the console.
